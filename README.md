# EducationTracker

in the terminal navigate to the repo folder (edtech)

run "npm start" to start the server

then on another terminal tab, run "node db/index.js" to initalize the database and tables

on the next terminal tab run "node db/dummydata.js" to populate the database with data

if you would like to access the database to see all the tables use "mysql -u root -p" and then leave the password blank

then "use edtech;" to select the correct database

in your browser go to "http://localhost:9000/" to see the page

you can create a user on your first visit, and then use that same username and password in the future, unless you reinitialze the database

Thanks!
